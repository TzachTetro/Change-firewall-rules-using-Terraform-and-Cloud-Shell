# Change-firewall-rules-using-Terraform-and-Cloud-Shell

## Purpose of the Project

The primary objective of this project is to enhance security and manageability of network configurations. By leveraging Terraform and Cloud Shell, the project aims to automate modifying firewall rules. This ensures consistent, repeatable, and efficient management of network security policies. Terraform's infrastructure-as-code approach allows for version control. Collaborative management of firewall configurations is also facilitated. Cloud Shell provides a secure and convenient interface for executing Terraform scripts. This occurs within the Google Cloud ecosystem. The project seeks to streamline deployment, update, and maintenance of firewall rules. This improves both security posture and operational efficiency.

## Features

- Automated Firewall Management: Leverages Terraform to automate the creation, modification, and deletion of firewall rules, ensuring consistency and reducing manual effort.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Uses Terraform's IaC capabilities to manage firewall configurations, enabling version control and collaboration.
- Cloud Shell Integration: Implements Google Cloud Shell for executing Terraform scripts, providing a seamless cloud-native development and deployment environment.
- Modular Design: Organizes Terraform code into reusable modules, promoting maintainability and scalability of firewall rules.
